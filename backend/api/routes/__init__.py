"""API route modules initialization - Modular API.

All endpoints organized by domain:
- auth.py: Authentication endpoints
- chat.py: Chat and conversation endpoints
- content.py: Content processing, TTS, OCR, embeddings
- batch.py: Hardware-optimized batch processing
- health_routes.py: Health, monitoring, admin, profile

Optimized for:
- Native Apple Silicon (M4) with MPS/ANE acceleration
- Multi-tier caching (L1 memory, L2 Redis, L3 SQLite)
- Concurrent processing with batching
